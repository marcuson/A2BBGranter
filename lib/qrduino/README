EMBEDDED QR CODE GENERATOR

Copyright 2010, tz@execpc.com.

Relased under ther terms of the GNU General Public License v3.

Targetd toward limited RAM systems - it tends to use more code and is slower but fits within an Arduino.

For linux/posix, type make.  For arduino, type make -f Makefile.avr.

qrenc defaults to version 6, level L ecc, but you can specify the version, or the version and the error level.

dofbits will generate a C file with the frame for one version/ecc level which will save a lot of RAM.  This file will link with qrencode.c
